- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Millama-Chan aka YACO, a young programmer who aspires to become a game developer in the future
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games, programming, design and animation
- ðŸ¤“ I also enjoy cosplaying and drawing random things but it has nothing to do with technology...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all of the above as well as with Japanese
- 
- ðŸ“« I don't have any social media, I think they are too toxic and a waste of time.
